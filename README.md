twinky-collector
================

a simple specialized node proxy using `request` that will relay 
POSTs to a given "route" to an upstream server. It provides a CORS
response as well but drops all other types of requests. 

See `config/default.json` for setup.

A docker container for this can be found at https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sbeam/twinky-collector/
